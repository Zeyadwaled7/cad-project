To obstruct its expeditious pace, early diagnosis is a must. But the confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests and other biochemical assays are not readily available in sufficient quantities. In this scenario, computer-aided monkeypox identification from skin lesion images can be a beneficial measure. Nevertheless, so far, such datasets are not available. Hence, the \u0022Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD)\u0022 is created by collecting and processing images from different means of web-scrapping i.e., from news portals, websites and publicly accessible case reports.\n\nThe creation of \u0022Monkeypox Image Lesion Dataset\u0022 is primarily focused on distinguishing the monkeypox cases from the similar non-monkeypox cases. Therefore, along with the \u0027Monkeypox\u0027 class, we included skin lesion images of \u0027Chickenpox\u0027 and \u0027Measles\u0027 because of their resemblance to the monkeypox rash and pustules in initial state in another class named \u0027Others\u0027 to perform binary classification.\n\n\n# Content\n\nThere are 3 folders in the dataset.\n\n1) Original Images: It contains **a total number of 228 images, among which 102 belongs to the \u0027Monkeypox\u0027 class and the remaining 126 represents the \u0027Others\u0027 class i.e., non-monkeypox (chickenpox and measles) cases**.\n\n2) Augmented Images: To aid the classification task, several data augmentation methods such as rotation, translation, reflection, shear, hue, saturation, contrast and brightness jitter, noise, scaling etc. have been applied using MATLAB R2020a. Although this can be readily done using ImageGenerator/other image augmentors, to ensure reproducibility of the results, the augmented images are provided in this folder. Post-augmentation, the number of images increased by approximately 14-folds. The classes \u0027Monkeypox\u0027 and \u0027Others\u0027 have 1428 and 1764 images, respectively.\n\n\n3) Fold1: One of the three-fold cross validation datasets. To avoid any sort of bias in training, three-fold cross validation was performed. The original images were split into training, validation and test set(s) with the approximate proportion of 70 : 10 : 20 while maintaining patient independence. According to the commonly perceived data preparation practice, only the training and validation images were augmented while the test set contained only the original images. Users have the option of using the folds directly or using the original data and employing other algorithms to augment it.\n\nAdditionally, a CSV file is provided that has 228 rows and two columns. The table contains the list of all the ImageID(s) with their corresponding label.\n\n\n# Web Application\nSince monkeypox is demonstrating a very rapid community transmission pattern, a consumer-level software is truly necessary to increase awareness and encourage people to take rapid action. We have developed an easy-to-use web application named [Monkey Pox Detector](https://monkey-pox-detector-mhealthlab.herokuapp.com/) using the open-source python streamlit framework  that uses our trained model to address this issue. It makes predictions on whether or not to see a specialist along with the prediction accuracy. Future updates will benefit from the user data we continue to collect and use to improve our model. The web app has a flask core, so that it can be deployed cross-platform in the future.\n\nLearn more at our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ShamsNafisaAli/Monkeypox-Skin-Lesion-Dataset)!\n\n\n# Citation\nIf this dataset helped your research, please cite the following articles:\n\nAli, S.
